DEV Instructions:

1. in Terminal, Run "npm run webpack-final"
2. to run server, run "npm run server"
3. open index.html in build/ folder

There are two npm scripts for webpack
  1: For hot module reloading to be used to front-end dev
  2: Builds bundle file into proper folder. Outputs final bundle.js


Folder Descriptions
  - Build
    => Folder where bundle.js is built to
    => Index.html lifes here as well at the moment
  - Server
    => Node/Express Server lives in server.js
  - Client
    => All React/Redux files will go here.  Probably CSS as well?
